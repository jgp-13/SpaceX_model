# SpaceX_model
- The commercial space age is here, and companies are making space travel affordable. One of the most successful companies is SpaceX. One reason SpaceX can do this is that rocket launches are relatively inexpensive. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars. Much of the savings are because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we determine the first stage success of landing, we can determine the cost of a launch. SpaceX's Falcon 9 launches like regular rockets. The cargo is carried in stage two and the first stage, which is large and expensive, does most of the work of the launch to orbit. 
- The price of each launch could be determined using the data of previous launches. The information can be gathered and analysed to create dashboards to predict success based on data analysis. 
- Also, it would be possible to predict if the first stage will land successfully using a machine learning model trained with public information.
- Python language and Pythonâ€™s libraries were used to make the analysis.
